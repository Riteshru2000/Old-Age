            <h2> KEEP Wheelchair</h2>
        <p>addition to providing mobility, an appropriate
              wheelchair benefits the physical health and quality
               of life of the users by helping in reducing common problems such
             as pressure sores and improve respiration and digestion.
              There are many types  of wheelchairs with
               varying features and benefits, One of them is Power Wheelchair.
               Power wheelchairs have a motor and rechargeable battery and are controlled
               using a joystick on the armrest,
                requiring only minimal effort from the user.
                Electric and manual wheelchairs both allow the user to
                get around and undertake daily activities without assistance. </p> </div>

            <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>

             Exercise produces endorphins (“feel good” hormone),
             which act as a stress reliever and leaves you feeling happy and satisfied.
               Exercise improves strength and flexibility.
               It may improve cognitive function (how your brain works),
               Activities like Sudoku or crossword puzzles can help keep your brain active,
                but little comes close to the beneficial effects of exercise on the brain.
               Regular exercise helps increase your metabolism and build muscle mass,
                helping your body to burn more calories.
